 Here we will create Shipping Screen with the following:
 1. Create form inputs
 2. We will  handle save shipping address
 3. We will add checkout wizard bar


 So basically we have made a component:
 1. CheckoutSteps.js 
 2. we have used this component in SigninScreen.js

 What checkoutSteps.js does is it takes two props from signinScreen provided that 
 weather steps are completed or not.After taking props checkoutSteps shows a bar
 which steps are comepleted with a color that we have imeplemented on index.css
