We will implement the increment and decrement button here
To complete this:
1.click handler for inc/dec item
2.click handler for remove item
3.click handler for checkout

if we refresh after implementing those functionalities our cart get's clear
to solve this issue we will save our items in the localstorage
and will save there and we will restore our cart from localstorage

We have used Navigate hook to navigate to the checkout page

We have implemented the feature in a way so that we can add items from
home page
